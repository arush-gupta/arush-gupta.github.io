I am Arush, a research therapist (only one in the world, I invented the job). 

Think of me as a consulting researcher: when you're stuck in your research, I provide fresh perspectives and new directions to help you pivot—for a small fee, of course.

My strength isn’t in executing research but in redefining problems, developing new models, and approaching solutions from fresh angles. I offer strategic guidance while ensuring academic integrity, helping you and your team move forward with clarity.

My motto, "Escaping from Hell," reflects my ability to navigate tough situations and break through stalled research—like a therapist, but for ideas.

I offer affordable one-hour sessions to unlock insights and accelerate progress—without the bureaucracy of academic networking.

When I am not a research therapist, I am an explorer. I explore the physical world, people, cities, and economies using tools from science, philosophy, history, economics, complex systems, and social dynamics — and, of course, my own two feet, hands, and ears.

Also, I'm currently listening to: Steal My Thunder (From "Twisters") by Connor Smith
