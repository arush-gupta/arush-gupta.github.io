Hello! I am an explorer.

I explore the physical world, people, cities, and economies using tools from science, philosophy, history, economics, complex systems, and social dynamics — and, of course, my own two feet, hands, and ears.

I'm currently listening to: Steal My Thunder (From "Twisters") by Connor Smith
