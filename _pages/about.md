I am Arush, a research therapist (only one in the world, I invented the job). 

You could think of me as a consulting researcher – it means that when you're out of your depth on a particular research journey, you can consult me, for a small fee, of course.

As of 10th March 2025, I’m positioning myself as a Research Consultant—what I like to call a "Research Therapist." I aim to help researchers and professionals break through barriers and pivot out of stagnation by offering fresh perspectives and new directions for stalled projects.

My strengths never lay in executing the research, but in problem definition and generating innovative solutions. By providing strategic guidance rather than doing your work for you, I help individuals and teams move forward with clarity and renewed focus, sort of helping them revive their stalled research engines.

I will offer affordable one-hour sessions to help people gain insights and advance their work. This approach will allow me to build my reputation as someone who can drive change without getting entangled in bureaucracy or emotional labor.

My motto, "Escaping from Hell," reflects my ability to guide individuals through tough situations, unlocking the potential of their strengths and helping them move past stagnated research.

When I am not a research therapist, I am an explorer. I explore the physical world, people, cities, and economies using tools from science, philosophy, history, economics, complex systems, and social dynamics — and, of course, my own two feet, hands, and ears.
