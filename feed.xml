Employers, lacking the time and resources to assess every candidate in depth, relied on a bachelor’s degree—especially from prestigious universities—as a reliable filter. A degree wasn’t just proof of education; it signaled intelligence, discipline, <strong>and most importantly, adaptability.</strong></p> <p>However, the hiring landscape has undergone a profound shift in recent years. Instead of reducing reliance on credentials, the rise of digital platforms—social media, LinkedIn, and open-access knowledge—has <strong>raised the bar for job seekers</strong>. Employers now have unprecedented visibility into candidates’ work, skills, and achievements. In theory, this should have made hiring more meritocratic. In reality, it has <strong>inflated expectations to unattainable levels</strong>.</p> <h2 id="the-new-hiring-paradox"><strong>The New Hiring Paradox</strong></h2> <p>What used to be a simple requirement—a degree from a good school—has now evolved into <strong>a demand for hyper-specialization</strong>. Increasingly, bachelor’s and even general master’s degrees are no longer enough to secure jobs in technical fields. Instead, many roles now <strong>require PhDs or years of niche expertise just to enter the field</strong>.</p> <p>This phenomenon is fueled by several factors:</p> <h3 id="1-global-competition"><strong>1. Global Competition</strong></h3> <p>The internet has expanded the hiring pool to a global scale. Employers can now access highly specialized talent from anywhere in the world, allowing them to be far more selective. What was once an exclusive skill set in one region is now commonplace in another.</p> <h3 id="2-credential-inflation"><strong>2. Credential Inflation</strong></h3> <p>As more people obtain degrees, their value as a differentiator diminishes. Companies have responded by <strong>raising their minimum requirements</strong>. Where a bachelor’s once sufficed, a master’s is now expected. Where a master’s was impressive, a PhD is now preferred.</p> <h3 id="3-short-term-optimization"><strong>3. Short-Term Optimization</strong></h3> <p>Employers increasingly <strong>prioritize immediate productivity</strong> over long-term potential. Instead of hiring adaptable employees and training them on the job, they seek “plug-and-play” specialists who already possess highly specific skills. This mindset discourages generalist problem-solvers and rewards niche technical mastery.</p> <h3 id="4-investor-driven-instability"><strong>4. Investor-Driven Instability</strong></h3> <p>Many companies, particularly in tech and finance, are under constant pressure from investors to optimize short-term efficiency. This has led to a hiring culture that values <strong>immediate returns over developmental growth</strong>, reinforcing the demand for pre-trained specialists.</p> <h2 id="the-death-of-learning-on-the-job"><strong>The Death of Learning on the Job</strong></h2> <p>A troubling consequence of this shift is the erosion of traditional career development pathways. Entry-level roles <strong>increasingly demand years of experience</strong> and niche expertise that were once developed on the job.</p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li>Journalists are expected to have extensive portfolios <strong>before</strong> even being considered for junior positions.</li> <li>Administrative roles that once required only organizational skills now demand <strong>software proficiency, data analytics experience, and specialized certifications</strong>.</li> <li>Engineering and data science jobs frequently list <strong>PhDs as a requirement</strong>, even for tasks that don’t inherently demand doctoral-level expertise.</li> </ul> <p>This shift has created a paradox: despite <strong>knowledge being more accessible than ever</strong>, breaking into technical industries is harder than ever.</p> <h2 id="the-consequences-a-workforce-in-perpetual-specialization"><strong>The Consequences: A Workforce in Perpetual Specialization</strong></h2> <p>Graduates today find themselves <strong>caught in a loop of endless upskilling</strong>. Rather than focusing on meaningful contributions, many are forced into <strong>relentless self-positioning—constantly chasing the next credential, certification, or specialization just to remain employable</strong>.</p> <p>This dynamic is unsustainable. It prioritizes immediate efficiency over long-term resilience, leading to:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Increased anxiety and job market uncertainty</strong> for young professionals.</li> <li><strong>A lack of investment in employee development</strong>, reducing overall workforce adaptability.</li> <li><strong>A fragile labor market</strong>, where companies hire for short-term needs but struggle with long-term retention and innovation.</li> </ul> <h2 id="breaking-the-cycle"><strong>Breaking the Cycle</strong></h2> <p>If this trend continues, we risk creating a system where <strong>the cost of proving competence outweighs the reward of employment itself</strong>. To build a more sustainable job market, companies must rethink credential inflation, as requiring excessive degrees for jobs that don’t genuinely need them creates artificial barriers to entry.</p> <p>Ultimately, the future of work must prioritize <strong>growth over gatekeeping</strong>. If businesses fail to adapt, they may find themselves caught in the same cycle of instability they have imposed on workers—constantly hiring, constantly replacing, but never truly building.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="economics"/><category term="labour"/><category term="market,"/><category term="socials"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How Social Media and Credential Inflation Reshaped Hiring]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Struggling in the Job Market</title><link href="https://arush-gupta.github.io/blog/2025/job-market/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Struggling in the Job Market"/><published>2025-02-25T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-25T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://arush-gupta.github.io/blog/2025/job-market</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arush-gupta.github.io/blog/2025/job-market/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="struggling-in-the-job-market-the-over-reliance-on-robotic-competence-25th-feb-2025-by-arush-gupta">Struggling in the Job Market: The Over-Reliance on Robotic Competence, 25th Feb 2025, by Arush Gupta</h2> <p><strong>TL;DR,</strong> The job market has shifted from valuing human competence (learning and adaptability) to robotic competence (immediate efficiency). Companies, pressured by short-term profitability and investor demands, now prioritize job-ready specialists over long-term employee development.</p> <p>Corporate instability has eroded job security, with mass layoffs affecting even highly profitable firms. Education’s role in hiring is declining—degrees no longer guarantee jobs, yet elite credentials still act as soft filters.</p> <p>Social media and global hiring have made recruitment hyper-competitive, leading to paradoxical expectations—requiring extensive experience for entry-level roles while offering little stability or career growth. Hiring has become more about filtering out candidates than fostering mutual investment, leaving workers in a cycle of uncertainty and constant upskilling.</p> <h3 id="the-shift-from-human-to-robotic-competence-in-hiring">The Shift from Human to Robotic Competence in Hiring</h3> <p>I define competence in two ways:</p> <p><strong>Human competence</strong> is the ability to learn and improve over time. It’s not just about performing a task but mastering it through experience. Some learn faster than others, creating a natural hierarchy—those who quickly refine their skills rise to the top, while others take longer to reach the same level. <strong>Robotic competence</strong> is the ability to perform a task efficiently from the start, prioritizing immediate execution over learning. It creates a hierarchy where those with existing expertise rise to the top, while those needing development are undervalued.</p> <p>For decades, hiring seemed to be based on <strong>human competence</strong>—the ability to grow within a role. Employers seemed to value intelligence, adaptability, and problem-solving ability, even if candidates needed time to ramp up. However, in today’s job market, the emphasis has shifted to <strong>robotic competence</strong>, where employees are expected to be immediately productive from day one.</p> <h3 id="corporate-instability-and-the-decline-of-long-term-employment">Corporate Instability and the Decline of Long-Term Employment</h3> <p>This shift is primarily driven by corporate instability, as companies face mounting pressure from competitive credit markets and the growing emphasis on short-term performance metrics. With the increasing uncertainty of long-term viability, many businesses rely on loans, venture capital, or credit lines to stay afloat, compelling them to pursue immediate profitability to satisfy investors and lenders. Failure to meet these expectations often results in reduced funding, prompting cost-cutting measures, layoffs, or even closures.</p> <p>While corporate giants are not facing the same existential challenges as smaller companies, they remain subject to similar pressures, such as investor expectations and market volatility. These firms prioritize short-term productivity by leveraging global hiring trends and focusing on specialized expertise to ensure immediate returns. At the same time, they assess candidates’ ability to withstand the demanding, high-pressure work culture. Despite this, they continue to invest in long-term talent development through robust training programs for new recruits. However, the risk remains largely with the employee—job security is uncertain, and layoffs can occur at any time, even for high performers. (Hence, “laid-back” jobs are now seen as rare, referring to the more stable 9-5 positions that once existed.)</p> <p>As a result, businesses are increasingly reluctant to invest in long-term employee development, opting instead to hire fully trained specialists while offering limited job security, pensions, or career advancement opportunities. By prioritizing immediate efficiency over organizational stability, companies shift the risks onto employees—engaging them on contract-based terms, maintaining stagnant wages, and eliminating traditional pathways for career growth. This dynamic fosters a labor market that values short-term productivity over long-term skill development, perpetuating an unsustainable cycle of uncertainty for workers.</p> <p>Mass layoffs are no longer exclusive to struggling companies; even highly profitable corporations are cutting jobs in pursuit of short-term efficiency. According to Statista, as of January 2024, Amazon had announced over 27,000 layoffs across five separate rounds, while Meta and Google reported approximately 21,000 and 12,000 job cuts, respectively. These reductions are often driven by shifting investor priorities rather than financial necessity, illustrating how corporate instability now extends beyond failing businesses to even the most successful firms.</p> <p>Startups, particularly those reliant on venture capital funding, also contribute to this instability. Aggressive hiring during periods of financial influx is often followed by mass layoffs when funding dries up. Companies like WeWork exemplify this boom-and-bust cycle, where rapid expansion is fueled by external investment rather than sustainable business models. This leads to unpredictable hiring patterns, where employees face abrupt terminations as soon as investor sentiment shifts.</p> <p>The gig economy further reinforces this instability. Companies such as Uber and DoorDash rely heavily on independent contractors, minimizing commitments to employee benefits, job security, and career development. While this model provides operational flexibility for businesses, it leaves workers in a precarious position—trapped in temporary roles with few opportunities for long-term growth or financial stability.</p> <p>Since firms are empowered to hire individuals who meet immediate needs, they have little incentive to invest in employees they intend to retain for the long haul. This creates a vicious feedback loop, with companies increasingly focused on robotic competence, to the detriment of long-term development and employee well-being.</p> <h3 id="the-decline-of-degrees-educations-waning-value-in-the-job-market">The Decline of Degrees: Education’s Waning Value in the Job Market</h3> <p>There has also been a huge erosion of faith in formal education as a pathway to employment. Traditional degrees once served as a proxy for human competence, signaling a person’s ability to learn and adapt over time. But as companies demand job-ready candidates with highly specific skills and focus on immediate productivity, degrees alone have become insufficient. Graduates now find themselves constantly chasing certifications and training programs just to keep up with ever-evolving job descriptions, further deepening their anxiety and uncertainty about the future. Meanwhile the cultural weight of academic pedigree still persists, creating a soft eligibility filter, where attending a top school is less about proving robotic competence and more about leveraging human competence as social capital just to open doors.</p> <p>However, this elevation in status matters less as job security erodes. Over the past two to three decades, the risk of redundancy has been rising. As the job market shifts further toward a gig economy model, human competence is losing relevance, replaced by a system that prioritizes immediate utility over long-term potential, undermining traditional seniority hierarchies. These hierarchies once made sense when companies valued long-term learning and growth, even if they were never perfect representations of human competence.</p> <p>The traditional belief that a college degree guarantees job security is fading. While tech giants like Tesla and Google have publicly stated that degrees are not required for employment, hiring patterns tell a different story. In reality, these companies continue to prioritize candidates from elite institutions, reinforcing existing hierarchies while maintaining the illusion of accessibility. This contradiction reveals the shifting role of degrees—not as a definitive requirement, but as a soft eligibility filter that still holds significant weight in high-profile hiring decisions.</p> <p>Beyond tech, inflated job qualifications are becoming the norm across industries. Entry-level positions now demand years of experience and specialized skills that were once learned on the job. In journalism, for example, aspiring writers are often expected to have multiple internships and portfolios rivaling those of mid-career professionals. Even administrative assistant roles frequently require a bachelor’s degree, proficiency in specialized software, and extensive industry knowledge, making it increasingly difficult for new graduates to break into the workforce.</p> <h3 id="the-competence-paradox-learning-vs-immediate-specialization">The Competence Paradox: Learning vs. Immediate Specialization</h3> <p>The problem isn’t just the system’s expectations—it’s that they fundamentally conflict. These expectations clash with the conditions humans need to work efficiently—such as purpose and stability—while also contradicting each other. Professionally, we’re expected to be robotically competent, yet culturally, we’re still judged by college degrees that signal human competence. The implicit belief is that robotic competence secures a job, but human competence allows you to keep it. However, if you’re too humanly competent but lack robotic competence, employers may see you as a short-term investment—someone who will quickly outgrow the role and move on. Conversely, someone with robotic competence but less human adaptability may be seen as a more stable, long-term hire.</p> <p>This creates a paradox: those who excel in human competence often struggle with robotic competence early in their careers. Ideally, human competence is about learning how to learn—developing as a generalist who can adapt to new challenges. Since the brain continues developing until age 25, early education should focus on broad learning abilities. In contrast, prioritizing robotic competence means mastering a single skill to the point of specialization. While this makes candidates immediately employable, it often comes at the cost of not developing the ability to learn and pivot over time.</p> <h3 id="the-cost-of-early-specialization-and-workplace-instability">The Cost of Early Specialization and Workplace Instability</h3> <p>As a result, young people are forced into a relentless game of strategic self-positioning, orienting their skills according to market forces rather than genuine interests or strengths. Instead of contributing to society in meaningful ways, they are preoccupied with “getting ahead,” despite a lack of clear structures that facilitate stable, symbiotic employer-employee relationships. This instability, combined with the expectation to specialize too early—before their cognitive development is complete—leaves many feeling confused and disillusioned about the job market.</p> <p>This isn’t just bad for individuals—it’s detrimental to companies as well. Imagine if businesses prioritized building positive relationships with employees rather than treating them as disposable assets. What if workers stayed not just because of profit margins but because they genuinely enjoyed working with their employers? A system built on mutual investment and dedication would benefit both sides far more than the current cycle of instability and short-term efficiency.</p> <h3 id="the-hidden-cost-of-office-politics-in-the-hiring-process-and-beyond">The Hidden Cost of Office Politics in the Hiring Process and Beyond</h3> <p>Then there’s the issue of office politics—many employees struggle with toxic workplace dynamics, but instead of getting proper support, they’re forced to either endure dysfunctional relationships with colleagues and bosses or actively engage in office politics to stay afloat. Some do it just to survive, while others exploit it to climb the corporate ladder. This highlights a deeper issue: corporate hierarchies are another form of robotic competence hierarchies. If you excel at office politics, you advance. If you don’t, you risk stagnation or getting pushed out entirely. This brings us back to the point about recruiters constantly checking for conformity to office political culture under the guise of “stress-testing” during interviews.</p> <p>Toxic work environments aren’t just a byproduct of individual personalities—they’re often deeply ingrained in company culture. In July 2021, Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit alleging a pervasive “frat boy” culture, where female employees experienced systemic harassment and discrimination. TIME reported that the company’s dismissive response led to employee walkouts, underscoring how corporate culture can be weaponized against workers rather than supporting their growth.</p> <p>Similarly, reports on Amazon’s warehouse conditions have shed light on extreme performance pressures and high turnover rates. Employees are expected to meet grueling efficiency metrics, often at the expense of their physical and mental well-being. These workplace dynamics reveal a troubling pattern: rather than fostering long-term development, many companies prioritize maintaining rigid hierarchies that reward endurance over meaningful contribution</p> <p>Maybe it’s time to acknowledge that the workplace sociopolitical environment itself needs serious psychological evaluation—rather than placing all the scrutiny on a new hire who knows nothing about office politics. Companies expect employees to “perform under pressure” without ever questioning whether that pressure is necessary, or if their selection bias simply favors those who can endure it, keeping the cycle going regardless of its actual value.</p> <h3 id="how-social-media-transformed-hiring-into-a-one-sided-market">How Social Media Transformed Hiring into a One-Sided Market</h3> <p>The proliferation of social media and professional networking platforms like LinkedIn has had a big part to play in dramatically reshaping this hiring landscape. What was once a job opening visible to 100 people in a town of 2,000 is now accessible to hundreds of thousands across the country, regardless of location.</p> <p>With the expectation that top-tier talent will inevitably apply—whether through referrals, job-sharing, or sheer necessity—companies are less inclined to compromise. The hiring process has become increasingly asymmetrical, with decision-making power concentrated in the hands of employers, creating a one-sided market. Rather than investing in workforce development, businesses now demand unrealistic combinations of expertise, leading to paradoxical expectations, such as requiring “5+ years of experience” for entry-level positions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, social media has also exacerbated the anxiety surrounding the job search. Platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, and TikTok have become spaces where professionals share their struggles—viral posts frequently highlight experiences of submitting hundreds of applications without a single response. Some job seekers admit to embellishing their résumés or tailoring their online personas to match corporate expectations, illustrating the growing desperation in an increasingly competitive market.</p> <h3 id="the-hiring-catch-22-rising-standards-declining-security">The Hiring Catch-22: Rising Standards, Declining Security</h3> <p>In response to financial insecurity, job seekers are applying en masse to various positions, often without regard for their qualifications, believing that the volume of applications improves their chances of securing employment. This influx of applications has led employers to develop an inflated sense of selectivity, prompting them to raise job requirements and seek highly specialized candidates without offering commensurate compensation. This specialization does little to improve candidates’ chances of better pay, as companies prioritize efficiency driven by market forces.</p> <p>This creates a vicious feedback loop: as companies set unrealistic expectations, job seekers panic and engage in unstructured upskilling, taking on certifications and courses to stay competitive. However, this only reinforces employers’ belief that highly skilled workers are abundant and easily replaceable. As hiring standards continue to rise, workers are left feeling permanently unqualified, while businesses paradoxically struggle to find the “perfect” hire.</p> <h3 id="from-hiring-to-filtering-the-rise-of-the-rejection-first-job-market-and-the-decline-of-mutual-growth">From Hiring to Filtering: The Rise of the Rejection-First Job Market and the Decline of Mutual Growth</h3> <p>Rather than serving as the start of a mutually beneficial relationship, the hiring process has increasingly become a rejection filter. Companies now focus on eliminating “risky” candidates and selecting the most “ideal” worker—someone who delivers immediate short-term value rather than fostering long-term growth and collaboration. This mindset discourages investment in employee development, erodes workplace stability, and fuels a culture of disengagement, where workers feel disposable rather than valued contributors to society.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="economics"/><category term="labour"/><category term="market"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Over-Reliance on Robotic

updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
